#Modify readfiles.cpp/.h PSF reader to include dihedral, use atbon/angle/dihedral class

#Make the inputfile reader a separate class, like DMD

#Make system.cpp file with a separate atomistic and CG setup

#Can the cgbond, cgnonbond class be used for atomistic reading too? 

#Removed velocity from ATBEAD class, confirm

#When reading input, can the beads only be formed with particles which are interconnected in atomistic trajectory?

#Define CG BEAD class, think of parameters useful
